# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?

float_ex = float(3)
int_ex = int(1.6)
div = 1.0 / 3

var1 = 4
var2 = 3
mult = var1 * var2

# The floating point value after the decimal point is lost during conversions from float to int
